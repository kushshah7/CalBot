# CalBot
Developed an interactive chatbot using Android Text-to-Speech and Android Speech-to-Text API's which counts and displays a user's daily calorie intake. A user sign up/login page was created using Google Firebase Authentication. A database was compiled using the most common foods, and an algorithm was developed in Java using Android Studio. The algorithm detects certain strings from the speech-to-text, and dynamically tells the user the number of calories of that certain food item using text-to-speech, and adds it to a daily intake progress bar. Future goals of this project is to integrate a backend database to save user progress and improve the chatbot to dynamically recommend certain types of food to ensure a healthier lifestyle.
